Here's a brief documentation for the to-do list project:

## To-Do List Application

This application allows users to create, manage, and persist a to-do list using local storage. Users can add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed or uncompleted. The user interface is designed to be responsive and visually appealing.

### Project Structure

- **HTML**: The HTML file (`index.html`) provides the structure of the application, including the task input field, add task button, and a list of tasks.
- **CSS**: The CSS file (`style.css`) styles the application to make it visually appealing and user-friendly. It includes transition effects, animations, and color schemes.
- **JavaScript**: The JavaScript file (`script.js`) contains the functionality for adding, editing, deleting, and toggling tasks. It uses local storage to save tasks so that they persist even after a page refresh.

### Functionality

- **Add Task**: Users can add new tasks by entering text in the input field and clicking the add button. The task is then added to the list.
- **Edit Task**: Users can edit a task by clicking the edit icon next to it. A prompt appears, allowing the user to modify the task text.
- **Delete Task**: Users can delete a task by clicking the delete icon next to it. The task is then removed from the list.
- **Toggle Task Completion**: Users can mark a task as completed or uncompleted by clicking on the task text. Completed tasks are crossed out.

### Usage

1. **Open the application**: Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. **Add a task**: Enter text in the input field and click the "Add" button.
3. **Edit a task**: Click the edit icon next to a task to modify its text.
4. **Delete a task**: Click the delete icon next to a task to remove it.
5. **Toggle task completion**: Click on the task text to mark it as completed or uncompleted.

### Styling and Icons

- The application uses Font Awesome icons for edit and delete buttons, enhancing the user experience with visual cues.
- The CSS file provides a modern color palette and transition effects to improve the aesthetics of the application.

### Persistence

- Tasks are stored in local storage, allowing them to persist even after a page refresh. This ensures that users can continue working on their tasks without losing data.

### Customization

- Users can customize the application by modifying the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files according to their preferences.
- Experiment with different color schemes, fonts, and icons to create a unique look and feel for the application.

### Conclusion

The to-do list application provides a straightforward and user-friendly way to manage tasks. With its intuitive interface and local storage support, users can efficiently organize their tasks and have them persist across sessions.
